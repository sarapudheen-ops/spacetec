# Detekt configuration for SpaceTec
#
# We currently use detekt as a reporting tool, but we don't want it to hard-fail
# the full Gradle `build` because the project is still being brought into
# compliance with the default rule set.
#
# When the codebase is cleaned up, lower `maxIssues` and/or introduce a baseline.

build:
  maxIssues: 10000

config:
  validation: true
