/home/yungblud/Desktop/SpaceTec/core/ui: Warning: Issue InvalidPackage was configured with severity warning in ui, but was not enabled (or was disabled) in library domain [CannotEnableHidden]

   Explanation for issues of type "CannotEnableHidden":
   Any issues that are specifically disabled in a library cannot be re-enabled
   in a dependent project. To fix this you need to also enable the issue in
   the library project.

   (This also applies for issues that are off by default; they cannot just be
   enabled in a dependent project; they must also be enabled in all the
   libraries the project depends on.)
